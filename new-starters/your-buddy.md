# Your buddy

We see your buddy as a trusted person you can go to for advice and support. Your buddy will set up agreed “informal formal” connections with you for your first three months while you settle in. They will guide and check in with onboarding, answer any questions and help you feel safe that your conversations are between you two. &#x20;

* Tips and tricks&#x20;
* Things they’ve learned&#x20;
* SixPivot inner workings (technology, people, project, domain, operations)&#x20;
* Share things they're/you're struggling with&#x20;
