# Access and licenses

We have a bunch of different systems that we use to do our jobs. Some things like Slack, everyone uses all the time so we will make sure you have access to these when you start. Other things, like whether you use JetBrains IDEs, are up to you so we'll only purchase or assign a license to these things on request (there's no "approval" process though, we just don't want to pay for things we don't need).

The common systems we use are listed below, but if you need access to something not listed here, reach out to Jayne or your manager and have a chat about it.
