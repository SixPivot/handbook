# READMEs

Everybody in the company has a [README](https://sixpivot.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/SitePages/Team-READMEs.aspx) (authentication required). We link out from our Slack profiles. Being a remote first team, it is a great way to get to know your team mates better. Some insights we gained from READMEs were:

* We learned we were pronouncing some people's name wrong
* For some of us English isn't our first language, and we need time to gather words
* We may be hard of hearing and need your camera turned on for lip reading
* Some of us are newer to Slack and are learning how to find things
* Some of us are night owls
* More than half of us are parents to children or fur children
* A lot of us have imposter syndrome

This is our blank template to prompt team members when filling out theirsðŸ‘‡
