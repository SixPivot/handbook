# Feedback

### Feedback culture

Being a remote first we rely on great communication, and we think improving feedback is part of that. Giving and receiving feedback is not a natural skill. Working with Organisational Psychologist, Dr Jessica Tonissen we are implementing a feedback culture in a meaningful way that fits best for us (not some sort of corporate tick box exercise).

### Rules of engagement for giving feedback

{% hint style="info" %}
Giving feedback should be: **Genuine, Actionable, Timely, Specific, Safe**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1. **Have positive intent**, focus of helping others improve. Feedback is not criticism.
2. Frequent and **as close to real time as possible**, however ask for an appropriate time.
3. Use the[ ](https://sixpivot.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FHR%2FShared%20Documents%2FFeedback%2FIEIC%20model%2Epng\&viewid=32273849%2D421f%2D43cc%2D89fe%2Da29c0440303a\&parent=%2Fsites%2FHR%2FShared%20Documents%2FFeedback)[**IEIC framework**](https://sixpivot.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FHR%2FShared%20Documents%2FFeedback%2FIEIC%20model%2Epng\&viewid=32273849%2D421f%2D43cc%2D89fe%2Da29c0440303a\&parent=%2Fsites%2FHR%2FShared%20Documents%2FFeedback) (authentication required).
4. **Ask for permission** to give feedback, make sure the receiver is in a good place to receive feedback - accept people not wanting feedback in that moment.

Other considerations for feedback giver:

* Allow the receiver time to reflect and ask questions, don't rush through the conversation
* Focus on actions, outcomes&#x20;
* Ask questions and listen to responses&#x20;
* Be ok with the receiver disagreeing with you, and deciding not to take action
* Positive and negative feedback is important, don't just look for opportunities in one or the other

### Rules of engagement for receiving feedback:

{% hint style="info" %}
Receiving feedback should be: **Safe, Respectful, Specific, Actionable**
{% endhint %}

1. **Assume positive intent**, know that the feedback giver is doing this with the aim to help you improve.
2. **Be respectful**, and give them your attention. This can be hard, resist the feelings of defensiveness.&#x20;
3. **Be thankful and mean it**, even if you don't agree. Appreciate that the giver has taken the time to give you feedback, most likely putting them in an uncomfortable position.&#x20;

Other considerations for the receiver of feedback&#x20;

* Be honest about your mindset, and defer the conversation if you need to
* Listen to what is being said, even though you might not want to
* Reflect on what you heard and ask questions, even if this means you need to defer the rest of the conversation
* Make a decision on what actions you can take and who will be responsible for follow up if needed. Giver, receiver, or both?
