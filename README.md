# Welcome!

This is the one place that you should be able to go to find out anything you need to know about how things work here at SixPivot.

This handbook has a few different audiences:

* New starters
* Existing team members
* People interested in joining SixPivot&#x20;
* People interested in how we work and getting ideas for their workplace. Feel free to take what works for you, if you should have success in implementing something similar, that's awesome ðŸŽ‰

By making it public facing and transparent it hopefully gives you confidence to keep us accountable internally (plus makes it real and reinforces our culture).

While we have done our best to capture everything you might need to know, we've almost certainly missed some things so if you find something missing - reach out on the #handbook channel on Slack and let us know.

Thanks to our friends at [Octopus](https://handbook.octopus.com/) for the inspiration for this handbook, as well as [Valve](https://archive.org/details/ValveEmployeeHandbook/page/n5/mode/2up) the original handbook of handbooks.&#x20;
