# Submitting expenses

To submit expense claims, you can use the Xero Me mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xero-me/id991901494) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xero.payday\&pli=1)), or via the Xero website. See [travel-and-expenses.md](policies/travel-and-expenses.md "mention") for details of what kinds of expenses can be claimed.

You should attach a copy of the receipt to the expense claim.

{% hint style="warning" %}
PDF receipts can be uploaded via the mobile app. Trying to upload them via the website doesn't seem to work.
{% endhint %}
