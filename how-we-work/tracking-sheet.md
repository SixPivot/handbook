# Tracking sheet

We have a lot of people and quite a few different clients and it can be hard to know where everyone is working at any particular time. The [Pivot's Tracking Sheet](https://sixpivot.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Sales/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4CFAE319-6D4A-4D1D-BFBD-6A13BDEB3853%7D\&file=A%20Pivot%27s%20Tracking%20Sheet.xlsb\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true\&DefaultItemOpen=1) (authentication required) allows us to see all that information in one place.

Jayne and the leadership team ensure that this is always up to date to the best of our ability. The leadership team also gets together at least once a week to review all of our current and upcoming engagements.
