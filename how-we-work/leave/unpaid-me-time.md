# Unpaid Me Time

Life is a lot, and sometimes you need a break.

If you want to have a break from work we will support you. Me Time is where you can take an extended amount of unpaid time, up to 12 months (or negotiated) - and your job will be guaranteed and waiting for you.

You don't need a reason, you can simply want to take time to do things like:

🧘 Have a mental health break

🎨 Write your magnum opus

✈️ Go travelling

💆 Take a career break

Whatever your reasoning is, if you need time, you will have job security. Hopefully it can make decisions around how you structure your life easier.&#x20;

**How to request Me Time:**

Talk with your manager about Me Time. They can guide and work with you around scheduling, customers and timelines.&#x20;

Note: leave benefits don't accrue while you're taking unpaid leave. This includes annual and personal leave as well as the time before you are eligible for long service leave.
