# Shutdown period

{% hint style="info" %}
All team have 2 bonus days leave for this period, so you don't dip into your annual leave too much.
{% endhint %}

During this time, we shut down for 2 weeks. With the public holidays and the 2 bonus days of leave, you will use 38 hours of annual leave (these are automatically applied for you, no need to request). Uninstall and unplug during this period, nobody is on Slack or working ðŸŽŠ\

Note: You can request to work over this period if you are planning leave elsewhere in the year, or some other reason. But we strongly recommend you take the time over this period.
