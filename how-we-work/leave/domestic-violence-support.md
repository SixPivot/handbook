# Domestic Violence Support

Family, domestic and sexual violence is a major national health and welfare issue that can have lifelong impacts. The Australian Bureau of Statistic 2016 estimated that two in five Australian adults have experienced violence, and that one in six women and one in seventeen men have experienced partner violence.

UNLIMITED paid domestic violence leave is available and designed to support everyone at SixPivot. It can be taken as a block of time or as individual days. We do not require evidence or supporting documentation with a domestic violence leave application when you are the person in danger or experiencing domestic violence.

We encourage team to seek assistance for domestic violence related concerns and are committed to supporting you. This policy applies to you if you are being directly affected and/or impacted by domestic violence.

### Inclusive of:

Our policy applies equally to people of all genders. Domestic violence and abuse can occur between opposite or same-sex intimate partners of any age, who may or may not be married or living together. It can also occur between family members, between carers and those they live with or care for in the home. Domestic violence and abuse can continue after a relationship has ended.

### Confidentiality:

We understand information relating to a team member’s situation regarding family and domestic violence is extremely sensitive and is confidential. Information will only be disclosed with your consent and disclosure of your situation is kept to a minimum and on a ‘needs to know’ basis.

### Domestic Violence and Abuse Definition:

Sometimes defined as intimate partner violence, family/carer violence or domestic violence, it is an incident or pattern of physical, verbal, sexual, emotional or psychological abuse. It can involve financial/economic abuse and control, and/or stalking and harassment that is perpetrated by one intimate partner over another. Domestic violence and abuse frequently involves control, coercion, threatening behaviour and abuse. It frequently takes place overtime, often starting with small acts of abuse such as:

<summary>Examples</summary>

* Cyber harassment: many of the forms of control, threats and stalking are carried out virtually through email, text messages, telephone messages etc.
* Stalking: workplace stalking often results in the perpetrator following a victim to and from their place of work or hanging around the workplace entrance.
* Emotional/psychological control and threats: can affect confidence and self-esteem and may also include control over social interactions and autonomy.
* Financial/economic abuse: control of finances, often used to prevent a victim from having the money to pay for transport to get to work, or to buy suitable clothing for work. Without financial independence, it can be very difficult to leave a violent or abusive relationship.
* Coercive control: a systematic pattern of behaviour with the purpose of undermining a victim and creating fear through threats, humiliation and intimidation and depriving an individual of support and independence. It is a psychological or emotional form of abuse that is used to control and limit the freedom of an intimate partner.
* Sexual abuse: unwanted sexual attention, including rape.
* Physical violence: involving hitting, kicking, burning, pulling hair, stabbing and shooting, leading to injury and in the worst cases death.

If you are concerned about your behaviour impacting your intimate partner or family/carer, you are encouraged to take domestic violence leave. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your behaviour is causing harm. Ask yourself:

* Have I ever tried to stop my partner doing something that they wanted to do? (for example, going out with friends, having a job, doing some study
