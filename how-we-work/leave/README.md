# Leave

### Types of leave

<details>

<summary><strong>üå¥ Annual and additional leave</strong></summary>

Get out of here, visit your loved ones, take a holiday, and unplug. Note many of our team uninstall work apps and go off-grid, we fully endorse this practice!

* 4 weeks of annual leave
* Preferably keep your accrued annual leave to less than 20 days (>160 hours). Exceptions to this may be needed from time to time, especially where leave is being accrued for significant life events.
* As part of your package negotiation, you can have up to an additional 2 weeks of leave, for a total of 6 weeks leave per annum
* When booking leave, annual leave needs to be used first with any remainder being taken from your additional leave balance.
* Additional leave is added each work anniversary and can accrue up to 24 months. Our preference is utilising it within the 12 month period. But if not, it rolls over for a further 12 month period. Note if it still unused by the next work anniversary it will expire.&#x20;

### **How to request leave \***

* Fill in a leave form in Xero. (See below for examples using the web or mobile app)
  * For a full day enter 7.6 hours (07:36 on the mobile app)
  * For a half day enter 3.8 hours (03:48 on the mobile app)
* Inform the relevant people (manager, your team, client)
* Reschedule/handover anything important
* Update your Slack status

_\*note that_ [_Switcharoos_](./#switcharoos) _are handled differently: please ping Jayne for your Switcharoo. Xero muddles it up and we prefer to update Switcharoos directly in our tracking sheet._&#x20;

### Example leave requests using web interface

Note the default for a single day is 7.6 hours. For a half day you would enter 3.8 hours.

For multiple days leave, you only need to enter the date range

### Example leave requests using mobile app

You can use the Xero Me mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xero-me/id991901494) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xero.payday\&pli=1)) to enter leave requests&#x20;

In contrast to the web interface, the mobile apps require you to enter time in HH:MM format (rather than decimal). A full day will be 07:36 (and yes you need the leading zero!). For a half day you would enter 03:48.

Note also that in the mobile app, the hours field defaults to 00:00, and it will require you to change that to a valid value before you can submit a request for a partial or single day's leave.

Like the web interface, the mobile app doesn't need hours when you select multiple days.
