# Travel and expenses

With our clients and team members spread across Australia, there are occasions when Pivots may need to travel to attend work-related meetings, events, or training. This policy details all the requirements, roles, and responsibilities for managing work-related travel and expenses.

**Local staff:** those living within 100kms of the location are effectively considered to be local and SixPivot will not generally pay travel expenses.  Those living outside of 100kms radius are treated as Interstate attendees.

### **When it comes to travel and expenses, our goal is to balance:**

* Fairness to you: when your travel is for business/PD reasons your personal budget should not be impacted
* When travel for SixPivot is optional or associated with social events we may co-contribute for certain events.
* Fairness to your colleagues: travel costs money, which could be used for other initiatives, so we ask for a bit of common sense to be applied when making your choices
* Our obligations: at the end of the day, SixPivot needs to be accountable. We need to ensure we have appropriate audit trails and timely payments. This leads to effective management of fringe benefits and other tax liabilities.

### **Reasons you may need/want to travel with SixPivot:**

* PD to attend a conference or speak at a conference
* Attend a training course as part of your PD
* Attend Summit
* Attend our annual retreat/social gatherings
* Attend other SixPivot meetings
* Attend client site

### **Client Site:**

If you need to travel as part of your client engagement and intend to claim expenses, then pre-approval is required. This should be raised with your Account Manager so that the travel and expenses costs and reimbursement of those costs can be agreed formally with the client. Once this has been agreed you should then proceed to lodge your expenses through the Xero Expenses app.

### **Vehicle Expenses**

If you would like to claim vehicle expenses such as KM‚Äôs, depreciation, fuel etc then you should seek advice from your chosen Tax Agent. SixPivot will not reimburse vehicle expenses.

### Travel Insurance

Please note that travel insurance is not covered by SixPivot. If you require travel insurance this is something you need to organise at your own cost.
