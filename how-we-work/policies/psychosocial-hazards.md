# Psychosocial Hazards

Many workplaces have physical hazards, such as dealing with mechanical devices, lifting heavy weights, or sitting too long in one position.&#x20;

Psychosocial hazards are anything at work that may cause psychological or physical harm. This includes bullying, harassment (including sexual harassment), poor workplace relationships, or experiencing traumatic events.&#x20;

Some hazards can have a greater impact in remote working situations, such as social isolation, communication challenges, work/life balance issues and workload management. This policy is to address psychosocial hazards here at SixPivot and step through our commitments to you and support we can provide. &#x20;
