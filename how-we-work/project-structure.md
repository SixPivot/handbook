# Project structure&#x20;

## Core Delivery Team

When we talk about our core delivery team, we're talking about the people that are on the ground, day to day, building cool stuff. In this team you're supported by a Principal Consultant and an Account Manager, and of course by the entire SixPivot team who are only ever a Huddle away.

A project team can consist of just our people, or a mix of our people and people from the client that we're working with. We don't mind either way - as long as the right people are involved for a project to be successful.&#x20;

### Our People

Different projects need different team compositions, but there's a few things that we try to do consistently.

#### Solo Gigs

We try not to have you working "alone", meaning "without other SixPivot people day to day".&#x20;

What does "alone" mean to us?

If you're augmenting a team of developers at a client (adding our developers to theirs), but you're the only SixPivot person in that team, we still consider you to be working "alone".&#x20;

Even if we have multiple SixPivot people working at the same client, if you're working in different teams or on different projects, you're still considered to be "alone".

There are two key reasons that we don't want you working "alone". Firstly, lots of us join SixPivot because we want to work with other SixPivot people. We're going to try and make that happen as often as we can. Secondly, we always want you to have someone sitting (virtually) next to you that you can bounce ideas off, run PRs[^1] past, etc., to make sure that your work is the best that it can be.&#x20;

#### Support

We try not to have Developers or Senior Developers working without Senior Consultants. We want you to have the support you need to do your best work.

We have different expectations of Developers and Senior Developers than of Senior Consultants, and generally every project benefits from the skills of a Senior Consultant.&#x20;

Sometimes we'll have a Senior Developer doing Senior Consultant things as part of their promotional pathway, but we still want to support them by having a Senior Consultant in the team to mentor them on their way.

### Other People

Depending on the project, there may be zero or many people outside of SixPivot in the core delivery team. These may include, but are not limited to, software developers, QA[^2]s, BAs[^3], PMs[^4], POs, etc.

We're happy to work with anyone that's needed to get the work done, be they clients or other consultancies. The important thing for us is that the right people are in the room to ensure a successful project.

## Roles

Roles at SixPivot are not to be confused with job titles. You may have one job title but be filling a different role, e.g., if you're a Senior Consultant on the pathway to becoming a Principal Consultant, you may fill the Principal Consultant role on a project.

### Team Lead

We're talking here about the team lead from a SixPivot perspective. A project with an augmented team may have a "Team Lead" as a position on the team which may be filled by someone else, but our Team Lead role is the person that's responsible for SixPivot's concerns within that team.&#x20;

As Team Lead, you're responsible for the day-to-day leadership of the team. While there might be multiple people on the team that could do this job, you're the single person identified as the team lead for a project so that we have a single point of contact for all the below.

The Team Lead role is to:

* Understand the scope of work to be performed
* Align with customer contacts
* Ensure a suitable agile process is being followed&#x20;
* Own the project communication, both for the client and for our internal teams\
  e.g., Weekly reports with customers and weekly check-ins with our SixPivot project team
* Set up regular communication within our team that is separate to the client project meetings&#x20;
* Own the Pull Request process\
  i.e., you don't have to PR every piece of work, but you need to make sure that PRs are being done by suitable people - we always want SixPivot people reviewing SixPivot work in addition to any client reviews
* Ensure the backlog is correctly managed\
  i.e., manage scope change, prioritisation, etc.&#x20;
* Act as coach and point of escalation for the SixPivot team, keeping an eye on team wellness&#x20;
* Coordinate scope and estimates for additional changes for tabling with PC for review&#x20;
* Table concerns and blockers with client project team in project meetings&#x20;
* Escalate relevant information to the PC in a timely manner

### Principal Consultant

The Principal Consultant role starts before delivery begins, runs through the duration of a project, and continues after delivery is complete.&#x20;

The Principal Consultant role is to:

* Validate the relevancy of an opportunity, define the scope, and estimate during presales
* Work with the Account Manager on the overall vision for the project and the client&#x20;
* Identify and assign the best people for the SixPivot team, and identify any onboarding and/or offboarding as required
* Initiate internal and external kick off meetings, including timings of engagement, setting of expectations, identifying blockers, etc.
* Identify and initiate a suitable agile process and the way we'll work&#x20;
* Create regular project team reviews to ensure we are on track and all blockers understood&#x20;
* Identify opportunities to share IP, technical scenarios, best practices, etc., with the rest of SixPivot
* Provide oversight and guidance for the SixPivot team lead and wider team, mentoring them from good to great&#x20;
* Act as point of escalation for the SixPivot team&#x20;
* Shield the project team where possible from wider client politics&#x20;
* Identify better practices&#x20;
* Capture knowledge&#x20;
* Manage the client relationship&#x20;
* Identify and assist in opportunities for SixPivot team's career pathways to progress
* Understand the wider client strategy and help guide the technical roadmap that helps them achieve their outcomes

### Account Manager

The Account Manager role starts before the delivery begins, runs through the duration of a project, and continues after delivery is complete. The Account Manager qualifies a client and/or project before engaging PC support for pre-sales activities.

The Account Manager role is to:

* Own the commercial relationship with the customer
* Own customer communications from a commercial/non-technical perspective
* Work with the PC to validate the opportunity, coordinate pre-sales activities, and deliver proposals
* Work with the customer and SC/PC on the overall vision for the project and the client
* Work with the PC to put together the correct team composition for the client and SixPivot
* Be a point of escalation for any client/team issues, etc.
* Have regular client and team catch ups for feedback purposes to ensure the project is on track, the team are happy, deal with any concerns, rotations, etc.
* For strategic clients, own the client account plan with input from the PC to ensure client goals are aligned
