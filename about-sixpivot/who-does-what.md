# Who does what

We're made up of many different kinds of people. What do they all do? Here's a rough idea.

{% hint style="info" %}
There's a bit more information about what everyone does on projects in [project-structure.md](../how-we-work/project-structure.md "mention")too.
{% endhint %}

## Developers and Consultants

Our developers and consultants make up the majority of the company. You're out in the field (virtually), helping our clients to deliver quality software by writing code, driving process improvement, and asking difficult questions. You work remotely, flexibly, and are all here because we see something special in you.&#x20;
