description: Our place to spend Good Vibes points
---

# Rewards shop

Check it out here: [https://rewards.sixpivot.com.au/](https://rewards.sixpivot.com.au/) (authentication required). You'll find things like gift cards, flights, accommodation and donations to charity or open source software/projects to spend your points on.

### How Good Vibes points work

* Every team member has $150 (in points) each quarter between 1 July to 31 May to allocate to other team members to say great work
* When Good Vibes are awarded a notification is shared publicly in #positive
* Good Vibes you _receive_ throughout the year can be spent in the store for yourself (more details and rules/exceptions below)

### How to allocate points

* (The easy way) in Slack you can type `/goodvibes [@someone] [amount] [reason]`, or
* In the Rewards Shop (via Achievements)

### How to check your balance

* In the Rewards Shop, top right hand corner (first number is to spend, second number is points to give), or
* In Slack you can type `/balance`

### Reset dates

To avoid carrying large balances of points year on year, we reset the points you can allocate and spend throughout the year:&#x20;

* Points to allocate are reset to 150 on the first business day following the quarter:
  * Q1: Jul, Aug, Sep    Q2: Oct, Nov, Dec   Q3: Jan, Feb, Mar   Q4: is Apr, May, June
* Please can you use your Q4 points by the end of May.
* Points do not carryover between quarters.
* June is a zero month for allocation points.
* You have until 30 June to spend your points in the Rewards Shop. What doesn't get spent is removed and reset to zero on 1 July.
  * You can "hold" points for future accommodation and laptop allowance top-ups and you can bank them up for the following financial year
  * JB HiFi vouchers cannot exceed $299 in one purchase, and please limit your purchases to a couple a year to help us stay within FBT rulings
  * Note that FBT rules only allow one portable device purchased within the FBT year (1 April to 31 March), so do some maths if you want to, say, get a tablet in the same year you get the laptop update
