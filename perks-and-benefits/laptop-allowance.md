# Laptop allowance

Your laptop is a key tool of trade and itâ€™s important everyone has one that meets their needs. Our Bring Your Own Device approach gives you the freedom to choose what suits you best. Hereâ€™s how we make the process easier with financial support ðŸ‘‡&#x20;

You can purchase the laptop yourself and expense back to us, or we can purchase the laptop on your behalf. This allows you to amortise the cost over a 2-year period.&#x20;

### How the laptop scheme works:

* You/we purchase a laptop that has a two-year warranty (up to the value of $4,400 inc GST) &#x20;
* We reimburse you for the cost of the laptop (if you purchased it yourself)&#x20;
* Over a 24-month period you will receive an allowance above your normal salary equal to the amount dedicated through salary sacrifice for the laptop; meaning there is no change in your net wages&#x20;
* If your laptop is over $4,400 you can use laptop top-up points through the SixPivot shop, or pay the difference through deduction in you next pay&#x20;
* If you exit SixPivot before the 24-month period, the remaining balance from the laptop scheme is sourced from your final pay and the laptop is yours to keep&#x20;
* Everybody at SixPivot owns their laptops&#x20;

Our team has put together a list of their recent [laptop recommendations](https://sixpivot.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/SitePages/Laptop-Recommendations.aspx) (authentication required) to help you make a decision if you're not sure.

### Laptop renewals:&#x20;

Youâ€™re permitted to purchase a laptop at any time after two years. Itâ€™d be great if you can give us a 4-week heads-up when you are thinking of replacing yours.&#x20;

To spread the impact on cashflow, we may occasionally ask you to wait longer. If you are asked to wait by us but want it straight away, you can get approval to buy it on your own and we pay you back at an agreed time.&#x20;

Equally if you need a new laptop at any time (even under 2 years) because there is an issue, and you are unable to do your job it will be approved immediately. &#x20;

### Finer details: &#x20;

Our intention with laptops is that we want to encourage you to have the right tool to do your job. We see laptops as a tool of trade that should be fit for purpose. Itâ€™s up to your discretion when you need a new laptop after two years â€“ we only ask (like any other policy) that you donâ€™t abuse it. &#x20;

For some context, we pay for your laptops upfront, and it can hit our bottom line significantly (when we have multiple people buying at once). &#x20;

We donâ€™t want to confuse laptops with â€˜benefitsâ€™ or â€˜perksâ€™ per se, as they're not an entitlement. However, there is nuance as the laptop scheme can be seen as beneficial for:&#x20;

* Onboarding team&#x20;
* Getting to choose your own laptop&#x20;
* Owning your laptop&#x20;
* And the tax benefit you have in keeping your laptop under salary sacrifice &#x20;
